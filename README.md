# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I attempted to build a convolutional neural network that trains on various pictures of dogs and cats with the end goal of accurately tagging pictures of dogs and cats.

Here are images of the datasets and training process

## Who Did What?

I worked on this project on my own, so I found a database of images of dogs and cats online and used a subset of the database to train my model. I created the CNN by following the tutorial.

## What you learned

The CNN worked well, but accuracy was not very high. I was able to accurately predict the classification of the image in the predictions directory but overall performance is not fantastic.
